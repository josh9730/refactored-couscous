  'Remove devices':
    - rh: "*NOTE* The work in this MOP is related to the freight pickups as discussed with Enrique/Lumen. The equipment from the racks here will be picked up along with the (palletized) equipment from the warehouse."
    - cmd-rh:
      - There are installed devices in racks 001.002, 001.006, 001.008 and CRS-1 (2.001) as follows
      - |-
        001.002: Brocade MLX-16, tri-bb-sw-1
        001.006: Brocade MLX-16, tri-bb-sw-2
        001.008: Brocade MLX-16, tri-hpr3
        CRS-1: Cisco GSR, tri-core1

        Each of these devices has been powered down per our notes, but this may be incorrect. All devices must be powered down.
    - rh: Once each device has been located and power confirmed off, disconnect and *dispose of* all connected jumpers from each device.
    - rh: Remove each device from the racks, and palletize each using the racks on hand (as discussed with Enrique).
    - rh: Each pallet can be placed in the warehouse or in the cage off to the side, as determined by RH. We will schedule a freight pickup as soon as this MOP and the warehouse palletization are completed.
