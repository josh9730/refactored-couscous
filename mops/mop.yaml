    'Locate and Replace Optic':
      - rh: Locate TUST1CA87TA1 Shelf 2 Slot 3 Port 2 in CL-10 Rack 003-007.
      - rh: Trace the jumper from Port 2. Provide NOC with the far end port details.
      - rh: Replace the optic in Port 2 with the shipped optic. Move the old optic to any free port in Slot 3.
      - noc: Verify optic is recognized, and update AMS.
      - rh: 'Locate and trace the following cross connect - 21396920. This is expected to be run as: A_Loc - LSANCA54ZG001 port 1 to Cabinet 1425 panel CP:1415:1211889 ports 11/12, Z_Loc - Panel 3.003.LC.A Ports 17/18'
      - rh: If the cross connect is located, please provide the serial number to NOC.
      - rh: The jumper from Port 2 should connect to the above cross connect. If this is NOT the case, please correct this so that Port 2 connects to the FRONT of the patch panel port, and the cross connect connects to the BACK of the same patch panel port.
      - noc: If RH is able to connect this, place a facility loop on Slot 3 Port 2, and verify that the link comes up. Note in the ticket if this is not the case.
